Welcome to the AnkFALL wiki!

We are a group of researchers from Robotics and Computer Technology Lab, from University of Seville (Spain).

For researching purposes we have collected a Dataset which contains events about Falls, Falling Risks and Activities of Daily Living from an Ankle-placed device (which contains a 3-axis accelerometer).

This dataset is under construction and the number of users and activities are increased continuosly.

Are you interested on it?

Here you are information about the activities taken into account, the number of users and the data amount; but, if you want access to our dataset, you'll have to fill the EULA document and sent us via e-mail. The information about this process in included in the EULA document.

Regards!
