Welcome to the AnkFALL Dataset wiki!

We are a group of researchers from Robotics and Computer Technology Lab, from University of Seville (Spain).

For researching purposes we have collected a Dataset which contains events about Falls, Falling Risks and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) from an Ankle-placed device (which contains a 3-axis accelerometer).

This dataset is under construction and the number of participants and activities are increasing continuosly: actually, it has records from 21 users performing 11 activities. Among these activities, there are 4 ADL activities, 4 Fall activities and 3 Falling risk activities; so, our dataset is the most balanced one.

Are you interested on it?

Here you are the information about the activities taken into account, the participants and the data amount; but, if you want access to our dataset, you'll have to fill the EULA document and sent it to us via e-mail. The information about this process in included in the EULA document.

Regards!
